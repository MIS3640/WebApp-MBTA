Assignment 3 Writeup

In this assignment we created a webapp that took user inputed location in the Boston metro area, and returned the nearest MTBA station to where that location
was, and if it was wheelchair accessible. To do this, we utilized APIs such as MapQuest and the MBTA API to pull the information from online, and outputed
the response on a webpage made with html and Python.

I used the framework kindly provided to us by professor Li to build the python app we would need to complete our task. The first step was to retrive and 
interpret a JSON object from the MapQuest API in order to find the latitude and longitude for any given point in the Boston Metro Area. We ran into our first
problem here. The API would not accept an spaces or special characters for an input, which we fixed by removing spaces with: "place_name = place_name.replace(" ", "%20")"
With that sorted we recived a tuple with the longitude and latitude of any place or address, completing our first step. Next we would need to find out whether or not the 
station was wheelchair accessible. I did this by returning part of the tuple with that information similar to how we found the cordinates. We then took both these functions
and combined them to return the information in a complete sentence. "The nearest station to {place_name} is {response_data[0]}, and is {accessible_info}". 
With the functionaly part sorted out, we then moved onto the webpage part of the assignment. Using Flask, I built several webpages such as an index, results page, and error page. 
I decided to use the POST meathod to allow the user to input a place, and then we took them to the results page with the output we created in Python.

I enjoyed this project a lot, to be able to connect the things we learned in class and actually see them online was very cool. I now have a greater understanding of how webapps work
and would like to continue building them. When trying out the functionaly of the project I often ran into errors in which I was not sure the reason for why I recived an error. Before
staring this project, I was completley new to FLASK, and it showed during the development stage. I constantly had stackoverflow and offical documentation pages open in order
to figure out how to do even simple things such as refer to other pages. On the other hand I was not as new to HTML as I was to FLASK. Building a webpage using basic HTML is something
I've done before. A strech goal for this assignemnt was to add some Java or CSS to the webpage to make it look nice. But unfortunatley due to time constrains I was not able to reach this
goal to a level I was happy with turning in. I learned that Java and designing webpages is a lot harder that I imagined. Overall I greatley enjoyed this project and am hungry to learn more
about webapps and the functionaly side of Python.
