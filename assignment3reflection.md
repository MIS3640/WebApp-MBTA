# Assignment 3 Reflection/Writeup
## Julia Chon, Oorja Shah, Dairaneara Haith

#### Project Overview

###### 
Our project is a tool that takes a place name and returns the closest MBTA stop, and whether or not the stop has wheelchair boarding. We have also built a simple website using HTML and Flask to showcase the tool. After being greeted, the user is prompted to enter a location. After submitting, the tool will run, and the user will be sent to a webpage with the results. If there is an error, the user will be prompted to return to the home page. We added CSS styling (internal and inline styles) to our webpage (colors, texts, buttons, emojis). We also used Javascript for the animation of the < h1 > tag. 

#### Project Reflection

###### 
We were able to complete the project in less than 12 hours. We managed our time effectively, and a team member already took the Web Tech course, so we were able to play to our individual strengths. We were able to understand the two goals we needed to accomplish so we split the work into two days: day one was for programming the tool in Python, and day two was for making the webpage. We ran the code each time we wrote a new line to see if there were any errors before moving onto the next line. We also handled errors together very well because there were three sets of eyes reading up on documentation, going through notes, and debugging the code. We looked through Flask documentation, class notes, and rewatched class videos to learn how to make the webpage. 
###### 
Moving forward, we will most likely be using Flask in our final project to create a map, so this assignment was very important in our understanding of Python. However, we wish that we had more practice understanding websites, and web pages before starting this project. Coding the tool was not the most difficult part of this assignment. Additionally, we found that it was better for us to program together over a conference call instead of splitting up to work independently, so we would be able to spot errors the moment they occurred. For two days, we used WebEx to code together, because there is a “share control” feature that allowed two people to code on the same screen. There were technology issues when one member’s laptop broke, and scheduling was difficult, but we worked well together.
