**Project Writeup and Reflection**
**Project Overview** [~1 paragraph]
*Write a short abstract describing your project. Include all the extensions to the basic requirements.*

In this project, our team coded an application that allows a user to input an address and then find the nearest MBTA station to that particular location. The code does this using JSON files and a MapQuest API that takes the longitude and latitude of the address and then find the MBTA station nearest those coordinates. The output of the code shows the address to the MBTA station as well as information regarding handicap accessibility. In order to complete this project, our team first began writing Python code in order to code the program to use JSON files as well as APIs. After doing this, our team coded a Flask application so that our python code can be seen in HTML as a working application. As a whole, this project showed us how to use APIs JSON packages, as well as Flask. 

**Project Reflection** [~2 paragraphs]
After you finish the project, Please write a short document for reflection [~2 paragraphs]


In doing our project, we believed it would help a lot to use the suggested functions that Professor Li provided. However, after starting the project we realized that there were a couple more functions we needed to code in order for our project to work. Nonetheless, the entire pair programming process went very well. Our team separated tasks, but worked together in order to make sure everything was running properly. To improve, our team could have had a more clear strategy to begin, but we were a little disorganized because of our inability to meet in person. The most difficult aspect of the project was creating the Flask application. Both Noah and Cristina have taken WebTech before so using HTML was not as much of a shock to them as it was to Julia. What our team could have done better was working together from the start on Flask instead of working on it separately. 

We wish we knew Flask significantly more before we began the project. Rather than doing adequate self-study before starting the Flask project, we sort of dove in without proper knowledge. However, this forced our team to use many resources such as Reddit, StackOverFlow, and class slides/videos. Going forward, our team plans to have a more organized strategy before we start any project as well as have all of the necessary knowledge. However, knowing what we know now, our team understands this project will help us immensely in future classes. 

Our team originally planned to complete the entire project using pair programming and we were successful in doing so, except for the process of coding Flask. Flask created many issues for our team as we were all very confused on where to begin. Reddit and StackOverFlow helped immensely, but did affect our communication as a team. The way we addressed those issues was by meeting over WebEx/Zoom so that we could demonstrate the code to the team members that either did not understand or were unable to help. 

*Also discuss your team process in your reflection. How did you plan to divide the work (e.g. split by class, always pair program together, etc.) and how did it actually happen? Were there any issues that arose while working together, and how did you address them? What would you do differently next time?*
