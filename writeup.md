# Project Writeup and Reflection

## Overview
In our project, we designed a website that takes a user input and finds the nearest MBTA station to the location that the user inputted. We designed this software by utilizing flask to integrate Python and HTML. When a user lands on the home page, they are first greeted with a "Hello," an overview of what the website does, a MBTA map, and a thank you to the MBTA workers that have worked throughout this pandemic. On the bottom of the home page is a place where users can input their location. After submitting their location on the website, our backend code in python will utilize both Mapquest's and MBTA's APIs, to first determine the longitude and latitude of the inputed location. Afterwards, it will find the closest location to that longitude and latitude. A new webpage will appear that displays the location they've inputted, the closest station, and whether or not that location is wheelchair accessible. There is also the possibility that there are no stations nearby, so the website will inform the user of that as well.

## Reflection
The project went relatively smoothly for our team. With members having some background in HTML combined with our newly acquired python skills, our main difficulty was figuring out how to integrate both languages together. Identifying how to integrate a user input into HTML that will work with Python afterwards took some online reasearch, but many posts on Reddit already addressed the situation, so those posts were quite helpful for us. We could improve on our overall website format by utilizing CSS to create a better design, as it currently appears as it was coded in the early 2000's. Another difficulty that we had was figuring out how to place an image onto the website. We quickly learned that we needed a static folder for flask to be able to integrate the picture, and that the image itself could not just be in the main folder alone. 


We planned to divide the work through pair-programming, but with everyones busy and conflicting schedules it was a little difficult to accomplish. Instead we opted for each individual to code a little bit on their own, and to send their code over when they were done. If any member encountered difficulties during the process, we were available via our group chat or call to discuss. Fprtunately, there were no issues that arose while working together. For next time, our final project, we plan to conduct pair programming as this was highly efficient during the second assignment and also allowed for a more even work distribution.
