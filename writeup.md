# Wirteup and Reflection for assignment 3

## Project Overview

In this project, we first imported 'json' and 'urllib.request'. By requesting data from the API URL, we got the latitude and longitude of a given place name or address in a json object. With the same algorithm, we got the information of the nearest MBTA stop and wheelchair accessibility with given latitude and longitude or place name. After finished writing the functions, we started to build our website. We created a form to request the user submitting the place name with ‘forms’. We checked if the submission is valid by adding ‘validators’. We used ‘render template’ to generate html within our program. We used **GET** and **POST** and ‘request’ to call the function we wrote before using user input. If the user input is valid, the user will be directed to **mbta.html** and get the  nearest MBTA stop and wheelchair accessibility of that place. Otherwise, the user will be directed into **error.html** which returned with an error page and redirect to the index page. We also created the **layout.html** to ensure that every page contains the name for our tool.

## Reflection
During the process, the coding of the main function went well. However we had a lot of difficulty while trying to call the function using user input from the website and post the output of the function on the website. We self-studied the GET and POST methods, the format of the html file and rendering template. We think GET and POST is an essential method which we will use in our final team project as our project is a highly user interactive website application. We wish we knew how to use this method thoroughly before we started because we spent a lot of time on figuring out how to request the input and process and post. 

We planned to divide work into two main parts: 1) writing the main function which would be used to process user input; 2) writing the html template and connect it with the main function code. We had a meeting via webex at the beginning and divided our work and after that we mainly used chat to discuss any progress. We frequently used the push and pull of github to see the changes of others and made improvements. We think that we are a very collaborative team and our mode of communication and collaboration works well to every teammate. Next time we will continue to use this way and we think we will work more efficiently as we are used to each other’s working style and time schedule.
