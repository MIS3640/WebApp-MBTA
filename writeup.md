# Writeup for the Assignment 3
* ## **Project Overview**	
    
    The overall objective of our project is to build a website that allows the user to input an address and choose the type of transportation and then returns the nearest station around that address. If there is no station nearby, then the program will return an error message “There is no MBTA station nearby with your selection of route type.” One extension that we added is the “stops,” which returns all types of transportation and allows the user to specify how they would like to travel. We also utilized CSS to improve the visual presentation of the webpage by changing the font, text color, center the text, the cursor, and adding some visual icons to the page.

* ## **Project Reflection**
    
    Overall, building the program, obtaining the API and creating the functions, went very smoothly. There were two parts that required extensive self-studying for us: reading the API documentation and the implementation of CSS and the use of “static.” We found that we wanted to understand the API data more thoroughly, so we had to read the documentation of the API which took some extra time. At first, we used CSS to center the text on our webpage, and tried to run it. After running it, and found that it worked, we tried to add more visual changes to the webpage and none of it would apply. After looking into it more extensively, we realized that it was because a static file saves the cache and makes the webpage immutable. We needed to use Ctrl + F5 to refresh the page and clean the cache. And we also have problem with getting the real-time arrival data from mbta api. Based on our code, the website can only show the realtime of rail. If we have more time or more instructions, we hope this problem can be clarified.
    
    Our plan for the project was to pair programming, so we just have one person writing the code, while the other two people were on a call. The issue we found with this was that we had to set aside a lot of time to work together and had to match our available times to each other. Another challenge was that if one person missed a part of the meeting, it was harder for them to get up to date. In the future, we could try to divide the work up by responsibility and then set aside time to come together as a group, so that we could save more time.
