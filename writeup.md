### __Project Overview__
We used the Mapquest and MBTA APIs to create an app that would tell a user where the nearest MBTA station to them is, and if that station is wheelchair accessible. We used a form on the main page that let the user input their location, and on submitting sent them to a page that showed the details of the nearest stop, or showed an error if there was no stop nearby. This page also gives the user the option to go back to the main page and try another location. 

### __Project Reflection__
Our team (Allyson and Blake) worked very well together. Both of us are great at bouncing ideas off of one another to problem solve. When one of us does something wrong the other uses their knowledge to fix the issue, repeating back and forth. We have found that using the pair programming method is very effective. Allyson will pull up the code on her screen and Blake will observe while expressing how the code could be changed to complete the task. We actually worked very quickly on this project and were able to complete each task easily. We did, however, hit a roadblock at the application phase. We found ourselves continually reaching an error screen when trying to submit our location. In response, we went back into our original code where we defined all of the functions and debugged. After a long amount of debugging we discovered that the issue is that our location did not have any stops nearby. After we fixed this issue everything worked smoothly.

Going forward, this exercise provided a lot of information and tactics for taking on our semester project. Allysonâ€™s HTML experience was already an asset for creating a user interface, but now that we know how to use flask we can create an application that our user can interact with. It was also very helpful to learn how to grab information with the API and return the proper output based on a variable. This will be useful when we want our journal to return information based on the mood that our user reports. When we find websites that have the information we need we can use an API to that website to provide encouraging thoughts. At this point we are fairly confident that we have the knowledge to complete our final project, but we are sure there will be some more roadblocks along the way. However, we now know how to successfully debug as a team, and are more confident that we can come out successful.
