# Assignment 3 Reflection 
# Project Overview: 
The latitude and longitude are given based on a location name through the mapquest API. The closest MBTA stop is then returned based on the longitude and latitude. An if statement was used for whether the stop was wheelchair accessible or not. 
# Project Reflection:
We were able to attempt the code over a few days and that helped with the process of fixing errors and understanding the correlations since we had more time to pay attention to details. We would focus more on details since the beginning because towards the end we found that many of the tiny details like indents and capitalization were giving us errors.The project had a big enough data set to sort through and also had a direction of finding wheelchair-accessible MBTA stations around the user. It has scope to improve and use more updated data sets. In terms of the project, we did have to do some self-studying in terms of the code for the form and for addressing the internal server errors with the HTML link. In order to have a better understanding, having some background on the forms and using the APIs together would have been helpful. In the self study, there were many different codes and methods that were available that didnâ€™t necessarily work when used in combination. It would have been nice to have that knowledge in order to focus more on making the program more detailed.
As a team, we followed the same method as the previous project with splitting work three ways. During this project, we followed that structure better than the previous time which allowed everyone to participate in creating code but it also helped with the momentum of completing the assignment.  We all had a better understanding of how we work and we all made improvements to help with creating better teamwork from the last assignment. When working together on this project, no issues arose that caused any concerns. We stepped in when necessary in order to support each other to the best of our abilities.  As for improvements, we could work on starting the project together earlier. This would allow for more opportunities to get responses in communication and also work ahead of any technical issues that we have been experiencing lately.
