    <h1>Project Writeup and Reflection:</h1>
    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>With the foundation of python and recent introduction to utilizing API, JSON processing, and Web App Development using flask library, 
        the projectâ€™s object was to use these tools to create a website that outputs the nearest MBTA location and its wheelchair accessibility 
        given the location input. </p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>Overall, I have achieved the goal of creating a functional website that gives a nearest MBTA station given the location. 
        I was able to successfully incorporate html and python, specifically flask library, where I created forms for an input that leads to an output. 
        Althought the project was bit difficult as I was not familiar with html and struggled on making connection between the html template and the python codes
        that I have created, it was a doable, good learning opportunity for me to challenge myself and to actually create my own first website that provide real value.
        In order to do so, I have had to obtain new html skills by myself through watching videos posted on youtube and reading the Flask user guide. 
        Furthermore, when creating the mbta_helper, I had to read documentations and learn to use URL and API keys. Through the knowledge from class and new knowledge through
        self-studying, I believe that I have gained useful foundation skills to further on the software design skills to build apps and website. Now that I was able to create this website, something I can improve on is to develop the website further to create more detailed and more dynamic
        website that could possibly give more of other outputs. I hope that I can further learn to advance not only python skills but also skill on other softwares to 
        produce advanced, aestheic, and valuable products. </p>
