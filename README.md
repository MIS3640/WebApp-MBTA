Link to [team reflection](reflection.md).

## Program Overview
This program is designed to allow a user to search for a location and designate a search radius that will be used to find the nearest MBTA stops and if the stop is wheelchair accessible. It uses the specified location and search radius to return data from the MapQuest API. The program will then use the latitude and longitude information to find the closest MBTA stops from the MTBA API. 

## Program Instructions
To begin, left-click on the program and select "Run Python File In Terminal".
### Default Values
This program will run with a default of 1 stop. The location and search radius are specified by the user.
