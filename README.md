# WebApp-MBTA
  
 Created by Shoaib Rahaman, Caroline Benson, Susanna D'souza for MIS3640. Base repo for MBTA project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md) provided by Professor Zhi Li.

 This was a class assignment in which my team built a simple app using the MapQuest API and MBTA API. Given an address in Massachussetts, the app will return the name of the nearest MBTA station from that address. The python functions and html code were built by my team after recieving the basic project template from our Professor.
