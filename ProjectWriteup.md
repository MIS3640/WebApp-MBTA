## **Project Overview**

Our project is focused on being able to provide information on the most convenient MBTA travel route based on the inputted position of the user.  Before making it interactive, we constructed functions that were able to return the name of the closest MBTA station, the distance between the two points and the wheelchair accessibility based on the linked web data. Our data is extracted using JSON web API requests from the MBTA website and Map Quest. Then, we created a web interface that was able to accept valid location inputs by the user and recognize locations that were not recognizable in the state of Massachusetts. Our error page is equipped with suggestions regarding how to troubleshoot the error and a return link to the original home page. For finishing touches, we enhanced the user experience by implementing cosmetic CSS features, such as imagery and different hues. 

## **Project Reflection**

From a process point of view, our team was extremely efficient and productive as we each took the initiative to contribute to the project before our initial meeting time. We were then able to make the most of our meeting time as we were aware of what issues needed to be discussed so we could learn and troubleshoot together. It was interesting that each team member’s comprehension of the code and material seemed to be extremely different. For example, Kevin’s strengths lied in understanding CSS, while Brandon was more comfortable working with API references. Each member of the team had to supplement their personal strengths by studying and strengthening the skills that they lacked. We took advantage of the suggested material and online forums until we were able to collectively overcome our obstacles. 

On a more constructive note, the division of work became easily apparent based on our skill sets. We also collaborated during our research by dividing specific topics and then making viewing suggestions for the rest of the team. Kevin focused on YouTube videos and was able to compile suggestion videos on the methods and formatting of HTML into python. Brandon focused on receiving the API keys and extracting the response data from the MBTA site. Anna focused primarily on the overall python code and discovering various methods for calculations. Our operations ran extremely smoothly for the most part as we were able to efficiently troubleshoot solutions together. One of our main struggles was making modifications to the code when we forked and pulled from member to member. As Kevin pulled, he had to ensure that the files were translated to HTM for development then back to HTML as a finalized web app. Anna found that she has to modify the names to certain variables, such as __name__, as they were missing components, such as underscores. This project was a success for us as we were able to learn while simultaneously collaborating. Our web app is fully functional and includes stylistic features picked by the team.
