### Project Writeup and Reflection
Please write a short document in [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (1 per team, not 1 per person) with the following sections:

**Project Overview** 
Write a short abstract describing your project. Include all the extensions to the basic requirements.

This project aims to help people find the nearest MBTA station with wheelchair accessibility. The project is composed of two parts. In part I, we use web APIs to access data and extra relative information for the project. The final product of this part is a function, written by Python, that can take a location name and return the closest MBTA station name as well as its wheelchair accessibility. The second part of this project is a simple website that actually interacts with potential users. Greeted first by the web app, the user has to enter a location name and then click ‘Submit’ to get the relative information. To run this project successfully, a user should install flask.

**Project Reflection** 
The most successful stage was the planning phase from a process point of view. Communication between the team allowed for the foundation of the program to be drawn out so that development was more efficient (on the individual level). There is space for growth with communication though, as individual team member's schedules hindered the project's progress. There was rigourous planning for unit testing, as a "break" in one function would make tracing the problem back to its source incredibly difficult. Thus, each function was stripped to its bare necessities and was built up after verifying that it performed as intended. The "radius" functionality was birthed from unit testing, and it allows for users to specify how far for the program to search. 

The team worked in a decent fashion for this project. The work was initially divided by one team member after her completed a portion of Part 1 of the assignment. Another team member editted and wrote the remaining code for Part 1 and Part 2. The geographic and schedule differences inhibited the use of pair programming as well as WebEx meetings, so the formal mode of communication was WhatsApp. The main issue that arose was the lack of communication nearing the latter end of the project, where the first team member had wrote the rest of the code for Part 1 and the other team member had already completed all the code for Part 1 and Part 2. There were some inefficiencies with this result, though it allowed for the opportunity of comparing implementation methods. 

To expand upon the logistical challenges of this project, by copying and pasting code to start contributing work made it difficult for the group later to solve conflicts while merging on Github. It was also difficult to see changes being made by other team members. Looking forward, there will need to be a greater emphasis in the division of work and increased communication for the team project.
