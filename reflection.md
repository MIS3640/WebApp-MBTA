**Project Overview:**

In this project, we built a web tool that takes an address or place name and returns the closest MBTA stop and whether it is wheelchair accessible. This tool allows users to easily navigate public transportation in Massachusetts by helping them overcome the complexity of the MBTA transportation map. To build this tool, we started by creating a function that uses an API from MapQuest to access the latitude and longitude of a given address or place in Boston. We also created a function that returns the closest MBTA stop from a pair of coordinates using an API from the MBTA site. By creating a function that calls the ones above together, we were able to return the closest MBTA stop from an address or place. Once these functions were ready, we created a simple web interface that asks the user to input an address or place. We connected the functions with the interface by using Flask so that the web tool returns the closest MBTA stop based on the input of the user. 

**Project Reflection:** 

From a process perspective, we did the entire project through pair programming. The team met in a video call with one person sharing the screen at a time. This approach worked well because the project was designed in a way in which each step of the functionality depended on the previous step, so dividing the work would have been more challenging. Also, having multi-day 2-hour sessions worked well, because it allowed us to immerse ourselves in the matter, but also take periodic breaks and look at the program with fresh eyes the next day. Starting early was a great call as well, because we were unsure of how long the project would end up taking, and we wanted to make sure we could meet with the professor if needed. We self-studied HTML before meeting so that we could all contribute, which was helpful given that one of our team members had not taken the Web Tech class. Going forward, we now understand the fundamentals of how to use Python as the backend for a web tool, which will be extremely useful with entrepreneurial ventures and other career projects.


There were also some challenges and aspects we could improve. Although this studying HTML beforehand was helpful, we were the least efficient in coding the HTML portion of the project - at one point, we had to bring the work to the professor for help with debugging. We wished we had more experience using ‘POST’ and rendering templates in HTML before this project, given that these are the most challenging aspects to us. Furthermore, the slight time disadvantage of pair programming did not outweigh the help we could offer each other and the benefit of real-time collaboration. That said, next time we could potentially divide the work to be a bit more time-efficient, and get more work done independently.
